## Overview

RecycLens addresses the challenge of urban waste mismanagement by helping users correctly classify and dispose of common household waste items (e.g., plastic bottles, sachets, nylon bags). The MVP demonstrates the feasibility of AI-guided waste sorting for urban communities in Nigeria and Ghana.

---

## Problem Statement

- Urban residents struggle to sort and recycle waste correctly.  
- Recycling rules in Nigeria and Ghana are inconsistent or poorly communicated.  
- Poor waste management contributes to pollution, environmental damage, and low recycling rates.  

---

## Project Scope

### **Overview**  
RecycLens is a lightweight AI-powered mobile prototype designed to help users in Nigeria and Ghana identify and correctly sort household waste. Using image recognition, the app classifies common waste items and provides simple disposal guidance to promote responsible recycling habits.

### **Objectives**
- Demonstrate the feasibility of AI-guided waste sorting using a fast, simple, offline-first model.  
- Enable users to identify household waste categories through image classification.  
- Provide clear, actionable disposal instructions to encourage proper recycling practices.

### **In Scope**
- **AI Image Recognition** for classifying: Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, and Non-Recyclable waste.  
- **Disposal Guidance** with simple user-friendly instructions.  
- **Offline Functionality** using TensorFlow Lite.  
- **Scan History** stored locally for users to revisit.  
- **Simple Mobile UI** built with Lovable no-code platform.  
- **Support for Android and iOS** (prototype level).

### **Out of Scope**
- Real-time map integration with recycling centers.  
- Cloud-based dashboards or analytics.  
- Rewards, gamification, or social features.  
- Multi-language support (English only for MVP).  
- Government or policy-level recycling compliance features.

### **Target Users**
- Urban residents, students, young professionals, and eco-conscious individuals in Nigeria and Ghana.  
- Anyone confused about proper waste sorting and seeking a quick guidance tool.

### **Success Metrics**
- ≥80% accurate AI classification.  
- ≤5 seconds image-processing time.  
- High user satisfaction (≥85% during testing).  
- Lightweight app size (<50MB).

### **Technologies & Resources**
- **Google Teachable Machine** – model training.  
- **TensorFlow Lite** – offline model conversion.  
- **Lovable.ai** – no-code app builder.  
- **Mobile Device Storage** – for offline scan history.

## Objectives & Goals

- **Build a lightweight AI tool** for waste classification and disposal guidance.  
- **Target Users:** Urban residents, students, young professionals, and environmental enthusiasts in Nigeria and Ghana.  
- **Success Metrics:**  
  - ≥80% correct AI classification rate  
  - ≥85% user satisfaction  
  - ≥60% retention for at least a second session  
  - Smooth performance on mid-range devices (<50MB, <5s response)

## Target Audience & Personas

**Primary Persona:**  
- Name: Amina Adeyemi  
- Role: Student  
- Goals: Quickly know how to dispose of waste correctly and contribute to a cleaner environment  
- Pain Points: Confusion about recycling symbols, labels, and proper disposal  

**Secondary Personas:**  
- Kwame Mensah – Young professional, wants fast, reliable guidance  
- Chinedu Okoro – Parent, wants to educate family and maintain a clean home
