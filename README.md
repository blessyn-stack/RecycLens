**Overview**
# RecycLens
RecycLens is an AI-powered prototype that helps urban residents in Nigeria and Ghana quickly identify and sort household waste. It provides simple disposal guidance for plastics, paper, glass, metal, and non-recyclables. Built with Lovable.ai, Google Teachable Machine, and TensorFlow Lite.
RecycLens is designed to help users in Nigeria and Ghana identify and correctly sort household waste. Using AI image recognition, the app classifies common waste items and provides clear disposal guidance to promote responsible recycling.

### Objectives
- Demonstrate the feasibility of AI-guided waste sorting using a fast, offline-first model.  
- Enable users to identify household waste categories through image classification.  
- Provide actionable disposal instructions to encourage proper recycling habits.

### In Scope
- AI image recognition for Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, and Non-Recyclable waste.  
- Clear disposal guidance for each item.  
- Offline functionality using TensorFlow Lite.  
- Scan history stored locally for users.  
- Simple mobile UI built with Lovable no-code platform.  
- Support for Android and iOS devices (prototype level).

### Out of Scope
- Real-time map integration with recycling centers.  
- Cloud-based dashboards or analytics.  
- Gamification, rewards, or social features.
